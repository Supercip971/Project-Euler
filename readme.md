my answers for the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) in c++

if you want to keep the pleasure of completing the problems don't look at this code until you have found the solution.

for each completed problem you will find a file: 
- \[problem-number]-problem-name.cpp 

note that this code is made for fun, however the answers may not be the best or most optimal
